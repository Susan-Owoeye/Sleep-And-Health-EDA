# Sleep-And-Health-EDA
## Overview

This project explores relationships between sleep patterns, health metrics, and lifestyle factors through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Key Explorations

Sleep duration distribution 

Stress levels' impact on sleep metrics

Physical activity correlation with sleep quality

Demographic variations in sleep patterns

Occupational effects on stress levels

(Detailed findings available in the notebook)

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle. It includes the following variables:

Sleep Duration and Quality metrics

Stress and Physical Activity levels

Health metrics (BMI, Heart Rate, Steps)

Demographics (Age, Gender, Occupation)

(Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/health-and-sleep-relation-2024)

## Current Status & Future Plans
### Current Status:
Complete EDA with visualizations and correlation analysis

### Planned Extensions:
Inferential Statistics (hypothesis testing, ANOVA)

Regression Analysis (linear/logistic models)
